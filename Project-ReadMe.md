# C4Prog-WT-PROJ

This project is about setting up a functional web page that can be displayed in various screen sizes
with links to different content/subjects. The pages themselves display information about
Dwayne Winter, showcases the work that he has done, and allows visitors to the site to get in contact
should they wish to.
