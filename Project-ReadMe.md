This project is about setting up a functional web page that can be displayed in various screen sizes
with links to different content/subjects. The pages themselves display information about
Dwayne Winter, showcases the work that he has done, and allows visitors to the site to get in contact
should they wish to.

The following colour scheme will be used when styling the website

| Name          | RGB           | HEX       |
|---------------|---------------|-----------|
| black         | 0, 0, 0       | #000000   |
| white         | 255, 255, 255 | #FFFFFF   |
| dark-gunmetal | 38, 31, 48    | #261F30   |
| ghost-white   | 236, 239, 255 | #ECEFFF   |
| pale-purple   | 137, 110, 172 | #896EAC   |
| water-blue    | 0, 163, 255   | #00A3FF   |
