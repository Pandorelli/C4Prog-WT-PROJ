                    Born and raised in country WA, my youth revolved around the outback, footy, and holidays to the beach.
                    I moved to Perth in 2002 to begin undergraduate studies and have lived there ever since. In that time I've
                    built a career as an Industrial Chemist, become a father, and I am constantly looking for new challenges.

                    I play and coach Aussie Rules football, as well as support the West coast Eagles in the AFL. I am also
                    an avid runner, partaking in trail and road runs, and I am currently building towards completing my
                    first marathon. I am actively learning Chinese and German languages, and I am keen on exploring/travelling the world.
